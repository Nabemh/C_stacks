C Stack [17 exercises with solution]
.

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations:

Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
Stacks entered the computer science literature in 1946, when Alan M. Turing used the terms "bury" and "unbury" as a means of calling and returning from subroutines. Stack follows LIFO data structure type.

1. Write a C program to implement a stack using an array with push and pop operations.
Expected Output:

Elements in the stack are: 3 5 4 3 2 1
